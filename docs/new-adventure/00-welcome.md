## App Camp at Build 2023

Here are the titles and abstracts of the Build sessions:

### Build Microsoft Teams apps leveraging existing software investments

_You may already be aware that Microsoft Teams is more than a collaboration tool; it’s also a platform for building collaborative applications. What you may not realize is that it’s designed to allow you to extend on existing web applications and services. Providing a Teams app can streamline the user experience and bring users into your app as they work day-to-day in Microsoft 365. In this hands-on workshop you'll build Teams apps based on existing web pages, REST APIs, and OpenAI artificial intelligence services. You'll learn how Teams apps work under the covers and how Teams Toolkit can speed up the development process. Please join us and begin the process of bringing your enterprise or ISV apps to Microsoft Teams!_

These labs will be the main focus of this full-day workshop. Students will also pursue App Camp labs [A-01, A-02, and A-03](/app-camp/#path-a-start-with-azure-ad) to learn how to reuse web-based applications as tabs in Microsoft Teams. They will also be invited to try the new [Extend](/app-camp/aad/ExtendTeamsApp/) lab to bring these pages into Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 home page.

### From Web Services to Teams Apps using Teams Toolkit v5.0

_In this hands-on lab you'll learn to bring business data into chat and email by building applications for Microsoft Teams and Outlook. These apps are based on enterprise and commercial REST services, which have become ubiquitous in today’s computing landscape. This allows users to share business context and bring recipients directly into your app in context. The new version of Teams Toolkit makes it easy! Don't miss out on this opportunity to enhance your development skills and build powerful Teams apps that can drive your organization's productivity._

This one-hour hands-on lab will feature Labs 1-4 in this series.
