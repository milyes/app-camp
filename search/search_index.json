In this on-demand workshop, you'll learn how to reuse your existing applications as Teams applications. In addition to a number of instructional videos (below), we offer two sets of hands-on labs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you have an existing web based application and are using tools that you like, check out the App Camp Classic Labs. Starting with a simple    web application, you'll learn to build a complete Teams application using no special tooling at all. The principles you learn can be applied to    any modern development approach.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you have web services you can consume, and would like to use the latest Teams development tool (Teams Toolkit), you'll want to try the App Camp: New Adventure, where you'll build a new app with Teams Toolkit that consumes your web services and exposes them as Teams message extensions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>App Camp is for learning concepts you can apply to your application</p> <p>The App Camp solution is designed to be simple and easy to understand; it is NOT production ready and should not be used as the basis for your coding project. App Camp teaches the concepts that allow Teams apps to be built on existing apps or app frameworks. If you want to get started quickly on a new application, please use Teams Toolkit.</p> <p>If you're starting from scratch, you still can learn a lot about Teams applications and monetization here!

The core labs will show you how to make the web application into a Teams application with a personal tab and Azure AD Single Sign-on. From there, you can choose extended labs depending on the features you need in your application. After completing each lab, the solution will still work as the original stand-alone web application as well as in Microsoft Teams.

The server side is also in plain JavaScript, using Express, the most popular web server platform for NodeJS. While the code is not production quality, the writers tried to follow best practices with respect to the various API's and SDK's in use, or to call out any exceptions in comments. As for things like robust exception handling, unit testing, build pipeline, etc., those are left to you, the developer; you probably already have a setup you want to use anyway.</p>"},{"location":"#lab-prerequisites","title":"Lab Prerequisites \ud83d\udcc3","text":"<p>The labs are intended for developers.

It includes a simple (and not secure!) cookie-based auth system based on the Employees table in the Northwind database.

As the users switch the themes, your application should also switch its theme so as to blend in. To detect theme switching in Teams client we'll have to use the global <code>microsoftTeams</code>'s context.</p> <p>We 'll add a function <code>setTheme()</code> to switch the css between the application's native style and the team's themes. Add this code to teamsHelpers.js:</p> <pre><code>// Set the CSS to reflect the desired theme\nfunction setTheme(theme) {\n    const el = document.documentElement;\n    el.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);\n};\n</code></pre> <p>In order to display the application in a particular theme, <code>setTheme()</code> applies a data-theme value in the root of the content, like, <code>&lt;html data-theme='dark'&gt;</code>, so the <code>teamstyle.css</code> will use a correct set of colors &amp; styles for each theme. The color change is done with the CSS variables.</p> <p>Now add in-line code into teamsHelpers.js to detect current context with <code>getContext()</code> and set the theme to match the current theme in Microsoft Teams. The code also registers an event handler that updates the application's theme when a user changes the theme in Microsoft Teams. Note that some browsers and the Teams desktop client will not honor the <code>await</code> keyword for inline code; therefore this code has been wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression.</p> <p>Copy and paste below code block for this purpose:</p> <pre><code>// Inline code to set theme on any page using teamsHelpers\n(async () =&gt; {\n    await ensureTeamsSdkInitialized();\n    const context = await microsoftTeams.app.getContext();\n    setTheme(context.app.theme);\n\n    // When the theme changes, update the CSS again\n    microsoftTeams.registerOnThemeChangeHandler((theme) =&gt; {\n        setTheme(theme);\n    });    \n})();\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"aad/A03-after-apply-styling/#step-2-start-your-local-project","title":"Step 2: Start your local project","text":"<p>Now it's time to run your updated application and run it in Microsoft Teams.

If you haven't done them, you can start here.</p> <p>Up to this point, the Northwind Teams application has had only \"static\" tabs. Static tabs are for personal use, and aren't part of a Teams channel or group chat. Each static tab has a single, static URL.</p> <p>\"Configurable\" tabs are for sharing; they run in Teams channels and group chats. The idea is that a group of people shares the configuration, so there's shared context. In this lab you will add a configurable tab that displays a specific product category so, for example, the Beverages product team can share a tab with a list of beverages. This saves them navigating through the app every time they want to see Beverages.</p> <p>The Teams manifest for a static tab includes the tab's URL, but for a configurable tab it includes the URL of the tab's configuration page.  The configuration page will allow users to configure what information is shown on the tab; based on this the configuration page saves the actual tab URL and a unique entity ID using the Teams JavaScript SDK. This URL can lead users directly to the information they want, or the tab to a page that looks at the entity ID to decide what to display. In this lab, the tab URL will display the product category directly, so the entity ID isn't really used. </p> <p>Configuration pages don't just work for tabs; they can also be used as setup pages for Message Extensions or Connectors, so they're worth learning about!</p> <p>In this lab you will learn to:</p> <ul> <li>Create a configurable tab with accompanying configuration page</li> <li>Add a configurable page to your Teams application</li> </ul> Video briefing <p> Configurable Tabs for Microsoft Teams </p>"},{"location":"aad/ConfigurableTab/#features","title":"Features","text":"<ul> <li>Microsoft Teams configurable tab to display a product category</li> </ul>"},{"location":"aad/ConfigurableTab/#exercise-1-create-a-configuration-page","title":"Exercise 1: Create a configuration page","text":""},{"location":"aad/ConfigurableTab/#step-1-add-the-configuration-page-markup","title":"Step 1: Add the configuration page markup","text":"<p>Create a new file /client/pages/tabconfig.html and add this markup (or copy it from here):</p> <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Tab Configuration&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/northwind.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"data:;base64,=\"&gt;

If you haven't done them, you can start here.</p> <p>In this lab, you'll allow users to purchase subscriptions for your Northwind Orders application as a transactable offer in a mock AppSource marketplace. This is similar to the purchase experience for apps listed in the Teams App Store, and it allows you to do this lab without a Partner Center account, which is required to create offers in the real AppSource. Additionally, you will integrate the Northwind Orders application with a simple licensing service that allows you to purchase licenses for your SaaS application. When you're done the Northwind Orders application will require a license to run in Teams, but will not require a license when accessing it directly. </p> <p>The AppSource simulator, as well as a sample license service, can be found in this github repository. The repo includes:</p> <ul> <li>An AppSource simulator (web site)</li> <li>A sample license service similar to one you need to provide for your app</li> <li>A web site with a landing page similar to the one you need to provide for your app</li> </ul> <p>You will need to install these services in your Azure subscription before this lab will work.

As the users switch the themes, your application should also switch its theme so as to blend in. To detect theme switching in Teams client we'll have to use the global <code>microsoftTeams</code>'s context.</p> <p>We 'll add a function <code>setTheme()</code> to switch the css between the application's native style and the team's themes. Add this code to teamsHelpers.js:</p> <pre><code>// Set the CSS to reflect the desired theme\nfunction setTheme(theme) {\n    const el = document.documentElement;\n    el.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);\n};\n</code></pre> <p>In order to display the application in a particular theme, <code>setTheme()</code> applies a data-theme value in the root of the content, like, <code>&lt;html data-theme='dark'&gt;</code>, so the <code>teamstyle.css</code> will use a correct set of colors &amp; styles for each theme. The color change is done with the CSS variables.</p> <p>Now add in-line code into teamsHelpers.js to detect current context with <code>getContext()</code> and set the theme to match the current theme in Microsoft Teams. The code also registers an event handler that updates the application's theme when a user changes the theme in Microsoft Teams. Note that some browsers and the Teams desktop client will not honor the <code>await</code> keyword for inline code; therefore this code has been wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression.</p> <p>Copy and paste below code block for this purpose:</p> <pre><code>// Inline code to set theme on any page using teamsHelpers\n(async () =&gt; {\n    await ensureTeamsSdkInitialized();\n    const context = await microsoftTeams.app.getContext();\n    setTheme(context.app.theme);\n\n    // When the theme changes, update the CSS again\n    microsoftTeams.registerOnThemeChangeHandler((theme) =&gt; {\n        setTheme(theme);\n    });    \n})();\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"bespoke/B04-after-apply-styling/#step-2-start-your-local-project","title":"Step 2: Start your local project","text":"<p>Now it's time to run your updated application and run it in Microsoft Teams.

True</p> <p>b. False *</p> <p>DISCUSS: Microsoft Graph is the main API for accessing all the content in a Microsoft 365 tenant.</p> </li> <li> <p>Where do Microsoft Teams applications run?</p> <p>a. Teams Application Host</p> <p>b. Teams Shared Service Provider</p> <p>c. Anywhere on the Internet *</p> <p>d. Skype Spaces</p> <p>DISCUSS: Teams apps can run anywhere on the Internet. Microsoft Teams accesses the application using information in the Teams app manifest, and stitches the app into the Teams user interface.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can show _____ on an adaptive card:</p> <p>a. Images *</p> <p>b. Input fields *</p> <p>c. Custom styles</p> <p>d. Action buttons *</p> <p>DISCUSS: Adaptive cards are designed to blend in with the hosting application, so custom styles are not available.

Space mission to Mars</p> <p>b. Tunneling program *</p> <p>c. Relational database</p> <p>d. Machine learning</p> <p>DISCUSS: ngrok provides a tunnel so requests from the Azure Bot Channel Service can be delivered to your locally running application during development.

What can you access using this token?</p> <p>a. Microsoft Teams JavaScript SDK</p> <p>b. The Microsoft Graph API</p> <p>c. The application's own back-end service *</p> <p>d. Nothing; this call returns an Identity token not an access token</p> <p>DISCUSS: It's a common misconception that these are ID tokens! If you inspect one in https://jwt.ms, you can see the audience claim is set to the application ID of your application, meaning it is an access token targeting your own back-end service.</p> </li> <li> <p>Who can consent to granting permissions to an application within a Microsoft 365 tenant?</p> <p>a. Any user</p> <p>b. Any user, but only for certain delegated permissions that are less sensitive *</p> <p>c. A tenant administrator *</p> <p>d. Microsoft, by making a request to the M365 Core Services team</p> <p>DISCUSS: For some simple delegated permissions, a user can consent. For anything sensitive (as documented in the Microsoft Graph API for example), as well as for any application permissions, an administrator must consent. If an app wants to avoid prompting users, it may want to prompt the administrator for all the permission needed, for example in the app's landing page that's shown when the app is purchased in the Teams app store.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your Teams SSO application wants to call the Microsoft Graph API, how should it obtain an access token to do this?</p> <p>a. Simply request it from Teams SSO</p> <p>b. Use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)</p> <p>c. On your application's server, exchange the app's own access token for a Graph access token using the On Behalf Of flow *</p> <p>d. Pass the username and password instead of a token</p> <p>DISCUSS: The OBO flow is used to exchange the app's token for a Graph access token. This must be done on a \"confidential client\" such as a web server, where the app secret can be safely used. It's a best practice not to send this token back to the client, where a user could obtain it and use it for other purposes until the token expires. So the app should make any Graph calls from the server and pass results, rather than the token, back to the client side.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"in-a-box/quiz/#commercial-marketplace-and-app-monetization-questions","title":"Commercial Marketplace and App Monetization questions","text":"<ol> <li> <p>When you sell in the Microsoft Teams app store, your app's licenses will appear in the Microsoft 365 Admin portal alongside Microsoft product licenses.</p> <p>a.

This led to a decision to make the App Camp labs using general-purpose development tools, so developers can learn how Teams apps work in sufficient detail to implement them with any tool chain.</p> <p>The tooling for building Teams apps - specifically Teams Toolkit, has improved since then, and many developers may want to build a new extension to their app using these tools. This led to this new set of labs, Teams App Camp: Next Adventure.</p> <p>In these labs, you'll learn how to leverage existing web services to become Teams apps using the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. While this doesn't allow you to choose just any tool chain, it makes it much easier to write a new Teams app and to deploy it in Microsoft Azure.</p> <p>In this lab you will learn to:</p> <ul> <li>Install Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code</li> <li>Create and run a Teams application with a Search-based Message Extension</li> </ul>"},{"location":"new-adventure/01-create-app-using-new-project/#exercise-1-set-up-your-microsoft-365-subscription","title":"Exercise 1: Set up your Microsoft 365 Subscription","text":"<p>To install and run your own Teams app, you'll need a Microsoft 365 tenant where you have administrator permission.

That means you might get partial queries. You can also tell Teams to call your message extension as soon as the user opens it up - with an empty query - using the <code>initialRun</code> parameter in the manifest.</p> <p>Notice that this function is calling a public web service, which is a sample OData database hosted by the OData team  and including an OData filter to select suppliers containing the user's query. It's worth learning OData because it's used on the Microsoft Graph, which is the server-side API for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams.</p> <p>The function returns an array of attachments. Each of these attachments includes an <code>itemAttachment</code> (which will be shown by default if the user selects an item), a <code>previewAttachment</code>, which is shown in the search results list, and a <code>value</code> which is passed to the <code>handleTeamsMessagingExtensionSelectItem</code> when someone selects an item in the search results</p> </li> <li> <p><code>handleTeamsMessagingExtensionSelectItem (context, selectedValue)</code> - This function will be called when a user clicks an item in the query search results. The <code>value</code> for that item (from the previous function) is passed in, so we can hand ourselves the data we need to create the adaptive card.</p> <p>The code binds this value to the adaptive card template with this code:</p> <pre><code>const templateJson = require('./supplierCard.json');\nconst template = new ACData.Template(templateJson);\nconst card = template.expand({\n    $root: selectedValue\n});\n</code></pre> <p>The function returns the adaptive card for insertion in the compose box in Microsoft Teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>#getFlagUrl (country)</code> - The cards were boring without any pictures, so this private function finds a flag image for each supplier based on its country. Thanks to https://flagpedia.net for the wonderful collection of national flags!</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"new-adventure/02-integrate-web-service/#step-2-add-the-adaptive-card-file","title":"Step 2: Add the adaptive card file","text":"<p>The new message extension will use an adaptive card to display supplier data.
